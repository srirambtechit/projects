Since cavemen were drawing on walls to sell sticks, content has been fundamentally transforming business. 
But now more than ever content is disrupting the traditional marketing approach. 
Why? Because consumers are in complete control of what they want to engage in. 
Twenty-five years ago big brands controlled the message through advertising and big media companies 
controlled the airwaves and printing factories.

Technology has changed the game. 
Consumers can ignore advertising and irrelevant content at will. 
To break through the clutter, brands need to tell remarkable stories that are worth 
listening toâ€¦and they are becoming the media in the process.
